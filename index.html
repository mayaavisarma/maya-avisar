        <h1>Hi, I'm Maya Avisar.</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">I help early-stage founders get things done — from scrappy systems to scalable operations. Think of me as your co-founder's secret weapon: turning chaos into clarity with just enough charm and just enough command-line.</p>

    <p>I solve problems that don't come with instructions. From leading operations at fast-moving startups to building AI-powered tools, I turn ambiguity into action and ideas into systems.</p>
    
    <p>What drives me is ownership. I'm not after checklists — I want responsibility, freedom, and the messy stuff no one else wants. I thrive when I get to solve, not just execute.</p>
    
    <p>I'm looking to join an early-stage team that needs a grounded, curious, get-things-done kind of operator.</p>

    <h2>What I Do</h2>
    <div class="skills-list">
      <div class="skill-item">
        <h3>Strategy Meets Delivery</h3>
        <p>I bridge R&D, business, and processes — turning vague business needs into scalable workflows, tools, or features. You get both big-picture thinking and day-to-day ownership.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="skill-item">
        <h3>Startup Ops & Execution</h3>
        <p>From zero to functioning systems, I've built and implemented tools and processes that fill the gaps no one else owns. Customer onboarding flows, support ops, dashboards — whatever the business needs to move forward fast (and without hand-holding).</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="skill-item">
        <h3>Technical Fluency</h3>
        <p>I'm not a developer, but I know enough to build what's needed — whether it's a quick MVP in Flask, a PostgreSQL query, a dashboard powered by automations, or integrating with APIs and MCP servers. Just enough code to move fast and unblock others.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="skill-item">
        <h3>Working Smarter with AI</h3>
        <p>I use advanced GenAI tools to do pretty much everything; build solutions, automate operations, generate insights — making myself 100x more effective.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="skill-item">
        <h3>People & Cross-Team Glue</h3>
        <p>I make sure things don't fall through the cracks. I communicate well with technical and non-technical people alike, and keep the business moving forward without the drama.</p>
